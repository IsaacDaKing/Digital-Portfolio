      No one, not your school, ISP, or government, has the right to eavesdrop on someone’s private communications without a warrant or, in regards to a minor, parental permission. Everyone has the right to privacy, even when it’s inconvenient to authorities. It is important to have a judge actually look at the authority’s case and decide if it’s frivolous or not. ISP’s can continue to run scanners that simply reverse image search downloads to see if they match any illegal pictures in their government issued databases, and if you are in some sort of group chat, in which multiple people send and receive messages, and one person consents to having their phone looked at(/has a warrant demanding that the data be looked at), then the government can still look at the data (without any permission from the others in the group chat). In addition, seeing as most people in school are minors, all the school needs is the parents permission.
