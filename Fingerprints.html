      There is a concept of “CA”, which stands for Certificate Authority. Websites prove their identities to these CA’s through real world documentation. When the CA believes the website is authentic, they digitally sign the website’s security certificate, placing their reputation on the line and vouching that the site is authentic.

      SSL interception is a very real threat that people are almost always in danger of. SSL interception cannot be prevented but it can be detected. When SSL interception is occurring, the public key will be different from the authentic public key.

      When dealing in Cyber-security, there is a threat of false positives and false negatives. A false positive is when a positive is detected, however, in actuality, it is a negative. A false negative is when a negative is detected, however, in actuality, it is a positive. However, in Cyber Security, a false positive is when a threat is detected but there isn’t one, and a false negative is when no threat is detected but there is one.

      No one, not your school, ISP, or government, has the right to eavesdrop on someone’s private communications without a warrant or, in regards to a minor, parental permission. Everyone has the right to privacy, even when it’s inconvenient to authorities. It is important to have a judge actually look at the authority’s case and decide if it’s frivolous or not. ISP’s can continue to run scanners that simply reverse image search downloads to see if they match any illegal pictures in their government issued databases, and if you are in some sort of group chat, in which multiple people send and receive messages, and one person consents to having their phone looked at(/has a warrant demanding that the data be looked at), then the government can still look at the data (without any permission from the others in the group chat). In addition, seeing as most people in school are minors, all the school needs is the parents permission.
