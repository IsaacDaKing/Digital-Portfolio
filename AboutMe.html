<h1> About Me </h1>
  <p>
    <b> Introduction</b>
    <br>
    Hello! My name is Isaac and I'm a Computer Science II Student. I want to use the knowledge gained in this course to become a <b>genius programmer</b>. However, I have absolutely no hobbies or things of interest or really anything that would make someone say "oh, interesting", and I lack even the most basic and necessary life skills. Sometimes, when I don't want to make a sandwich, I just tell my family that I don't know how. However, the fact that they honestly believed that for such a long time is far more insulting to me than it was for me to lie to them originally. One time my father told me to do one thing and my mother told me to do another, and since their orders conflicted with eachother, I spent the next 5 minutes walking in a circle like my brain short-circuited.
