    <h1>AI Sentience Essay</h1>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence has the potential to lead to a new age of humanity, a utopia if you will, but it does not come without concern.
      A primary concern, stoked by the likes of Elon Musk, is that our goals will not align with that of the AI, and thus, the AI will see a need to eliminate us in order to reach their goals.
      However, this is complete science fiction, nobody is saying to give an AI a body and a gun to see what happens. In robotics one of the central rules is that no robots should bring harm unto a human, granted, many governments don’t feel the need to take this one too seriously.
      However, governments themselves have a large interest in making sure that the AI don't decide to kill all humans, seeing as they are human themselves. In addition, it seems doubtful that true Sentience can <i>ever</i> be achieved artificially, 
      it's likely that there is something more to life then just the ability to recognize patterns. Whatever that "more" is can be decided upon by one's religon or personal beliefs, but the fear people have that the story of AI Sentience will end like that of the Tower of Babel seems likely to stay for the forseeable future. 
      Maybe we shouldn't play God anyway.
