  <b> Paragraph </b>
  </p>
  <p>
For my ISP I will be working on the back end of the model scheduler. The model scheduler is a program that will allow Allen High School students to start to prepare for scheduling their classes for next year. It will do this by giving students a blank schedule and giving them free reign to fill it with the classes they want for next year. In addition, the program will tell the students if certain classes are compatible with one another. Compatibility for the most part depends on the A-day B-day schedule as well as the four different campuses students can have their classes in; Allen High School, STEAM Center, Lowery Freshman Center, and Collin Technical Campus. It will likely be difficult, if not impossible, to accurately create schedules for students with classes in Collin Technical Campus due to the different times that campus operates on. However, the STEAM Center, Allen High School, and the Freshman Center, all, for the most part, follow a uniform schedule, so that will be relatively simple to incorporate into the project.
