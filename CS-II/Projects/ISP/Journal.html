    <b> Week 2: 9-Jan-2023</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Technical Challenges:</u> A massive technical challenge this week was setting up the Github repository, issues, issue categories, labels, and making sure that everyone was properly linked and added. I personally had a little bit of trouble in using my personal authentication token, but after I solved that, I managed to contribute and commit several changes to the repository. In addition, I had to aid many of my colleagues, who could not properly link the Github repository to their command line or did not know how to switch between branches of a repository from the command line. This, alongside general confusion regarding what the front-end team’s minimum viable product should look like, slowed us down significantly. However, I’m hopeful that the coming weeks will iron out all confusion and produce a solid minimum viable product.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Scheduling Challenges:</u> Scheduling has been a complete mess this week due to failure to properly communicate from across the team. Even when the project and product managers managed to come up with a plan with roles associated with certain jobs within the plan, many of the software developers and the QA developers would simply not choose any roles until forced to. This impeded the efficiency of the scheduling process greatly. In addition, some group members are still not assigned to roles (particularly in regards to front-end, I understand the back-end has their own plans), so unless this gets sorted over the long weekend, I’m afraid we will have to still deal with this next week.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Interpersonal Challenges:</u> There has been a lot of aggression and poor communication from different parts of the team. Personally, I have not been involved with these negative interactions, neither as an aggressor nor a victim. However, I feel like I understand where both sides are coming from, because of our poor style of communication and the feeling of project stagnation alongside general confusion of how to start from scratch and what our minimum viable product will look like, we are lashing out in our frustration against one another. Hopefully, everyone will be able to look objectively at the issues at hand and understand that everyone wants what is best for the project.

    <u>Scheduling challenges:</u> Project has not yet reached the scheduling portions of development.

  <p>
    <u> Interpersonal challenges:</u> I know many of the team members on a personal basis, and I know many of them exhibit introverted qualities. I am worried that despite their brilliance, they will be unable to let their voices be heard. The easy way to mitigate this is to ecourage an environment in which they feel safe to contribute and communicate. It's also important to use positive reinforcement rather than punishing mistakes.

  <p>
    <u>(Software) Development Engineer:</u> A software engineer is responsible for the overall base building of the software. This is going to be the most common role within the team. They need to work well together and be able to write easy to follow code in order to make the Quality Assurance engineer's, Release Engineer's, and one another's job easier. Difficulty comes for the development engineer in that they have to put together their own vision of what to do, and tinker with that based on the demands of the other team members. The Development engineer has to start from scratch, they don't change pre-existing code.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>QA Engineer:</u> The QA Engineer, or Quality Assurance Engineer, is responsible for checking the code written by the development engineer that may in some way affect the program or readability of the code. The Quality Assurance Engineer must run many tests on the program and also be in constant communication with the other team members in order to have a clear picture of what each part of the program does as well as what each part is supposed to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Project Manager:</u> The Project manager is responsible for delegating tasks to the Development Engineer and the QA Engineer and is in charge of keeping the project in line with previously established deadlines. The Project Manager has to work with everyone the Development Engineer, the Quality Assurance Engineer, the Product Manager, and the Release Engineer in order to make sure that the entire project is completely on track as envisioned. The project manager alongside the product manager may have to make tough decisions in regard to what parts of the originally envisioned project may have to be cut in order to reach completion by the deadline
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Product Manager:</u> The product manager is responsibly for building, implementing and managing the software, or in layman terms, responsible for planning and preparing for what the finished product will be like. They have to be in communication with every aspect of the team in order to do their task optimally. The Product Manager must work closely with the Quality Assurance Engineer and Development Engineer in order to garuntee readability of the code. In addition, the Product Manager should work closely with the release engineer in order to assist as best as possible in the transition from local code to a fully functioning website.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>Release Engineer:</u> The Release Engineer is concerned with the compilation, assembly, and delivery of source code into finished products or other software components. In this case, they will be responsible for the transition from locally created temporary practice builds to the finished product. The most important part of the release engineer's job is to make sure that the program does not lose any of its functionality during the transition.
