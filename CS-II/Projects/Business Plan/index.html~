    <h2 class="centertxt">Identity </h2>
  <p>
    Smartshop is a filtering system made to choose optimal clothes for the client based on their needs and preferences (which will be inputed by the client themself)
  </p>
  <h2 class="centertxt"> Problem </h2>
  <p>
    In today's world of fashion, many people are overwhelmed by the choices and styles that are available through online shopping and massive clothing chains. Their's a huge population of people who feel as though they don't have enough knowledge about clothing and fashion to utilize these resources. In addition, even if people do eventually figure out what style they like, fashion trends always change. Many people lack the interest or time to follow these trends.
  </p>
  <h2 class="centertxt"> Solution </h2>
  <p>
The solution is a filtering system which can filter clothes and give a display/list to people depending on the following criteria; physiological needs such as height, weight, and gender, as well as personal preferences such as fashion choices, preferred clothing companies, budget, etc and display a list based on these criterias. In addition, the program would have an admin who can manually set catagories with recent trends.
  </p>
  <h2 class="centertxt"> Target Audience </h2>
  <p>
Generally, the target audience is everyone that is not inclined with fashion, this can be a great product for those who live a very busy lifestyle and do not have time to shop, those who are unable to afford expensive clothing that they like, those who simply can not be bothered to go through with the time it takes to pick out clothes that they like or go shopping for such.
  </p>
  <h2 class="centertxt">Competition</h2>
  <p>
    The primary competition here would be wholesale retailer websites, and brick and mortar stores. Websites due to them having the ability to utilize filtering systems like the ones weâ€™re designing, and brick and mortar stores due to them having a large collection of items that people can walk in and shop for.
  </p>
  <h2 class="centertxt"> Revenue Streams </h2>
  <p>
    Our main revenue stream will be through affiliate marketing. This is where stores will pay us for sending our users to buy from them. We may also display advertisement on our website for increased revenue.
  </p>
  <h2 class="centertxt"> Marketing Activities </h2>
  <p>
    Marketing would be done primarily through internet advertisement, and word of mouth as these are the cheapest and most effective options possible for us.
  </p>
  <h2 class="centertxt">Expenses</h2>
  <p>
    The primary expenses would be keeping the website online with server costs, a secondary expense being salaries of employees as well as sustenance.
    </p>
