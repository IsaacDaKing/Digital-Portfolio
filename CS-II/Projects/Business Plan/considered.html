    Despite the fact I really like the idea of walking into class and instantly having my attendance marked, I feel like the core concept here has issues. People may change their looks drastically over the course of breaks. In addition, many students opt to wear masks over the course of the school year, and some people wear religious head coverings to school as well (many doing it in combination with a mask). Additionally, sometimes students may forget to scan themselves, or if it’s set to scan them automatically, will face their heads towards whoever they’re talking to (thereby accidentally avoiding any sort of camera). I think a normal ID scanner as well as a teacher confirming those who are absent is the most automated we can get in this regard.

    While still a good idea, there is just way too much competition for this specific product for it to be viable. Despite the fact they acknowledge the competition, reading through their Business Plan, I fail to see anything that sets this product apart from any of those already on the market, and the pre-existing companies have had plenty of time to gain the trust of the consumer. Therefore, I don’t have much interest in working on this project.

    Although I liked both the idea and the inventor (he’s cool :-) ), the proposal did not exactly change anything in order to fix the fact that people need help in physics. There are already plenty of resources for someone to use in order to master AP Level physics, such as Pearson, Khan Academy, and Albert.io. The problem stems from lack of time or interest in improving for the class. As such, another help app that districts can pay for will not change anything, they should rework the curriculum to find better ways to engage students.

    I considered this idea because I thought it was useful (I could stay up all night studying). In addition, the presentation looks really cool and over the top. However, I would have no idea how to contribute and it seems too complicated for me. I also don't understand how a product like this is supposed to make money.

    I definitely thought this idea seemed useful and unique. However, I am not very good at hardware related things, and I’m not sure this is very sustainable for anyone except the super-wealthy. Even then, you would need a lot of room for it, so wouldn’t the consumer rather just order it online? Also, I don’t really care if my food is locally grown or not, and I’m not sure if the average consumer cares either.

    I considered this idea because I liked the team members, and I thought the idea wasn’t that bad either. However, I don’t think this will reduce cost or increase safety for anyone. Firstly, you would still need security guards to pull people without their ID to the side. Secondly, there is no way for the scanner to know if the person wearing the ID is actually the person walking through the scanner. Thirdly, I think most security threats to high schools tend to be high school students themselves, and this will only really help to stop people who are clearly not high school students from entering the building (which security guards can already do). In addition, this type of system can promote complacency for security guards. Essentially, this system adds cost, creates complacency, and only can detect people who don’t have an ID, but that ID does not necessarily have to be theirs.

    This is a decent idea for people who want to get involved in the community. But that is also the problem; not many people want to get involved in community events. I think that this idea won’t catch on and there will be no revenue. Cities, like Allen, would probably prefer to mail an occasional magazine, like the Life in Allen magazines that Allen residents receive in the mail. Spreading awareness on this application would also be difficult because frankly, people who want to go the community events are probably fine with the Life in Allen magazines and are not looking for an improvement.

    This is simply an extremely difficult project. Programming an AI to fly a plane will be extremely difficult for an ISP. Tesla has been working on AI for a car for several years and they still haven’t figured out how to make it work, so there is no way several high school students could program an AI for a plane. Also, if we do manage to create this AI, getting approval from the government to put this in a commercial plane will take a very long time. This idea simply requires too much effort.

    This is a great idea, but it will require a lot of research. Creating this product will require researching illnesses so much. There are thousands of different illnesses, some have very similar symptoms. The symptoms quiz might also be long if the user wants an accurate diagnosis. Also, not everyone experiences the same symptoms making this even more challenging. And finally taking this quiz would feel like one of those pick your own adventure type of things and I think it will be hard to make this app look polished and sophisticated.

    I ended up going for my group's idea because I think it's genuinely helpful to people like myself, and I want to help build on the idea I contributed to. In addition, I like the people I will be working on it with. I don't think it will be too difficult because there are a lot of different resources we can use to learn the skills required to make this (especially now that we have basically the rest of the school year to work.
