    <h1> Why my Digital Portfolio is Important to me </h1>
    <p> I want a hub to be able to look at all of my work and <s>flex on</s> show to people, and It will be nice to have most of my high school work in one place to look back on. In addition, if I want to start making some <b> cash </b> then I can use this to show to businesses and get hired, thereby increasing my progress towards world domination.
