    <h1> Why my Digital Portfolio is Important to me </h1>
    <p> I want a hub to be able to look at all of my work and <s>flex on</s> show to people. In addition, having a hub to collect and store all of my work gives me a good place to look back on in the future and compare my current and past work and see how far I have come. Also, if I make anything super cool I can have it here to show off everything about it.
