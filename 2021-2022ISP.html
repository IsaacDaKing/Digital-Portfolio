      <b>Concept</b>
      <br>
      You click on Willem Dafoe to get oranges. However, enemies are trying to steal his oranges, so you have to click on them as well (extremely complicated). The enemies (as PNG's) would start offscreen and slowly advance on the Willem Dafoe PNG at the center of the screen. If the enemies (who included Somali pirates and Federal Agents) made it to Willem Dafoe, you would have to pay a penalty. If Willem Dafoe hit 0 Oranges he would <b> DIE </b>. You could buy upgrades through the shop on the bottom right side corner that would make it easier to kill enemies and farm oranges. We initially planned a semicomplicated offshore banking system (in which you try to avoid taxes without getting audited), but we ended up scrapping that idea.

      <b>Motivation</b>
      <br>
My group liked Willem Dafoe.

      <b>Conclusions - what went as expected; what did not, and why</b>
      <br>
The basic function of the game went well, but we lazied out of the banking system and making a better looking shop system. In essence, the big problems emerged when we figured out how much work/time certain things took. After we would figure that out, we started avoiding non-essential tasks.
